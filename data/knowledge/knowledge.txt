To solve this problem, we can sort the array and compare it with the original array. If the sorted array is equal to the original array, then it is possible to sort the array by performing right shift operations.
To solve this problem, we need to check if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations. We can do this by counting the number of right shifts required to sort the array.
