Then each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\n    Note: \n        1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\n\n    For example:\n    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    collatz_sequence = []\n    while n != 1:\n        collatz_sequence.append(n)\n        if n % 2 == 0:\n            n = n // 2\n        else:\n            n = 3 * n + 1\n    collatz_sequence.append(1)\n\n    odd_numbers = [num for num in collatz_sequence if num % 2 != 0]\n    return sorted(odd_numbers)"}
